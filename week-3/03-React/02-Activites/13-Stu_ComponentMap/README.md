# Component Map

In this activity we will map over a list of data and render components from each piece of data.

## Instructions

- Open `reactpractice` app and replace your React application's `src` folder with [src](Unsolved/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `yarn start` or `npm start`.

- Open the application in your web browser and study the rendered application. Then take a minute to study the included components:

  - **App**: Our Application's root component.

  - **List**: Responsible for rendering an unordered list from `props.data`.

- Modify the `List` component so that inside of its `ul` tags, it renders one `li` tag for each item in array of grocery objects being passed via props. Each `li` tag should display the `text` property of each grocery object. The array map method should be used for this.

### Hints

- You should definitely look at [React's documentation for lists and keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

- See MDN Documentation for [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).

- You will only need to modify the `List` component.

### Bonus

- Inside of the `List` component, render a list of **only** the groceries which **have not** been purchased. Use the [Array.prototype.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) to filter the array before mapping.
